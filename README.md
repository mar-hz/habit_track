# Habit Tracker

Made using Flutter and SQLite as a practice! 
In the future, I want to use it to learn to apply themes and allow the user to choose the main color.

Features:
* Adding and removing daily habits
* Editing habit names
* Heatmap of daily habit completion
* WIP slidable drawer for user preferences (theme)
